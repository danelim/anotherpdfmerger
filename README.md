# anotherpdfmerger

This is a simple pdf-merger that adds bookmarks to the merged PDF
corresponding to the filenames of the PDFs being merged.

This is heavily based off of Yan Pashkovsky's code
[here](https://superuser.com/questions/1009939/how-to-merge-pdfs-and-create-bookmarks-for-each-input-file-in-output-file-linu)
which was apparently first authored by Nicholas Kim. Yan Pashkovsky made
a Java version of the above code which you can check out
[here](https://github.com/Yanpas/PdfMerger).

My version differs from the Python one above in that the bookmark names
only include the file name, not the full path.

More text to follow when I finish coding this.
